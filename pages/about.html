      I'm a software engineer with a background in IT resource management, and I work on the front end of the stack. My primary code language is TypeScript, with React as my default framework. I'm a habitual learner, dedicated to living the maxim of "learn something new every day". I've held a variety of positions over the years, all of which have shaped me into someone who is perpetually curious and always seeking to learn and grow. My latest formal endeavor has earned me a certification as a ScrumMaster.

      I was recently employed at HqO, Inc. as an App Release Engineer, with my primary role being to organize and automate the release process for HqO's apps. During my tenure, we scaled our release process from handling 50 whitelabels to over 170. More than just releasing new versions of existing apps, I also launched a fair number myself. In March 2022, I was interviewed for the <i>Inside HqO</i> series, which you can view as <a class="link" href="./public/Inside-HqO-Interview.pdf" target="_blank">a PDF here.</a> If you want a more granular view of the other work I did, take a peek at my

      I've been on the receiving end of some truly extraordinary mentorship and friendship over the years. I believe in paying it forward, and would be more than happy to lend a hand if I'm able. Please feel free to <a class="link"
      href="#contact">reach out</a> if you need someone to look over some code, or have questions about best practices in building websites. If I don't have the answers, I can leverage my network to find someone who might. Software is a remarkably helpful community, and we all benefit from this cooperation.

      I enjoy reading immensely--mostly fantasy and science-fiction--with an annual goal of at least 45 books. I delight in visiting used book stores, scouring the shelves to see where I can add to my collections. My personal library currently sits at almost 1200 books, and I can't wait to add more. One of my dreams is to have an entire room of a house be wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.</p>

      I am a self-taught drummer who jams to blues, blues-rock, and rock. I use a blend of Paiste, Meinl, and Sabian cymbals to round out my sound. Not surprisingly, my musical tastes extend far beyond my skills behind the kit. As a listener I'm particularly drawn to the syncopated rhythms of jazz, progressive rock, & progressive metal, and delight in the opportunities these genres have for experimentation and improvisation.

      I enjoy watching sports, and have dedicated much of my viewing time to AS Roma, a professional soccer team based in the Italian capital, and Clemson Football, in support of my alma mater.

      The past 6 years I've eagerly awaited each summer's Tour de France, and this year have found out just how big the world of cycling truly is. Discovering GCN+ has given me access to over 190 televised races in 2023 alone, and I've watched every one of them! It has inspired me to spend more time on the bike, and I've found I enjoy pedalling away just as much today as I did when I was a child.

      I have a passion for travel, and have been to 15 countries and 23 US States. I'm fascinated by other cultures, and dedicate a majority of my time abroad bouncing from one museum to the next, and documenting my travels with my trusty Canon camera. Beginning in 2021, I dove headlong into nature photography. It's something I've been dabbling with for ages, and decided to fully commit to it as a "professional hobby" that summer when I upgraded to a new lens. You can read more about that journey at my
